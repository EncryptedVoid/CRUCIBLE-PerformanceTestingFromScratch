## 1. Getting arguments and parsing them

**Conceptual Approach:**

- Use `getopt` or `getopt_long` - standard C libraries for parsing command-line arguments
- Define a clear structure for your command-line interface
- Support both short options (`-d 60`) and long options (`--duration=60`)
- Group related options logically (component selection, test parameters, output options)

**Key considerations:**

- Error handling for invalid arguments
- Default values for omitted arguments
- Help text and usage documentation
- Support for configuration files as an alternative to command-line arguments

## 2. Using arguments to configure logic and behavior

**Conceptual Approach:**

- Create a central configuration structure that holds all settings
- Use a modular approach where each component reads what it needs from the config
- Implement validation checks for configuration consistency
- Use an initialization phase to prepare the environment based on configuration

**Key considerations:**

- Configuration hierarchy (defaults → config file → command line)
- Runtime reconfiguration capabilities
- Component dependencies (e.g., if testing storage, ensure filesystem access)
- Graceful handling of unsupported configurations

## 3. Retrieving and storing system data

**Conceptual Approach:**

- Use system-specific APIs and libraries for hardware access:
  - `/proc` and `/sys` filesystem on Linux
  - `libsensors` for hardware monitoring
  - `sysinfo()` for system statistics
  - `/dev` interfaces for direct device access
- Abstract hardware access through dedicated modules
- Implement platform detection for cross-platform support

**Key considerations:**

- Permissions and access rights (may need elevated privileges)
- Sampling frequency and overhead
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Fallback mechanisms when sensors/data unavailable

## 4. Storing data in structs

**Conceptual Approach:**

- Define clear, purpose-specific structs for different data types
- Use nested structures for hierarchical relationships
- Consider data locality for performance
- Include timestamps and identifiers with all measurements

**Example structure hierarchy:**

```
TestRun
  └─ ComponentResults[]
       └─ MetricSamples[]
            └─ DataPoint (timestamp, value, unit)
```

**Key considerations:**

- Memory management (allocation/deallocation)
- Size efficiency for large datasets
- Thread safety for concurrent access
- Serialization for storage and reporting

## 5. Validating data points

**Conceptual Approach:**

- Implement range checking for all metrics
- Define expected value ranges per hardware/platform
- Use statistical validation for time series (outlier detection)
- Apply data quality assessments (consistency, completeness)

**Validation techniques:**

- Absolute bounds checking (min/max values)
- Rate-of-change validation
- Cross-metric correlation checks
- Sensor health verification

**Key considerations:**

- Handling anomalous but valid readings
- Different validation rules per platform/hardware
- Invalid data reporting mechanism
- Recovery strategies for validation failures

## 6. Logging data

**Conceptual Approach:**

- Create a centralized logging system with multiple outputs
- Support different logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Implement both human-readable logs and structured data formats
- Use atomic operations for reliable filesystem writing

**File management:**

- Create timestamped directories for each test run
- Implement rotation for large log files
- Support different formats (text, CSV, JSON)
- Include metadata and test configuration

**Key considerations:**

- Performance impact of logging
- Disk space management
- Crash recovery for incomplete logs
- Thread safety for concurrent logging

## 7. Performing stress on all components

**Conceptual Approach:**

- Implement specialized stress generators for each component:
  - CPU: Mathematical operations, encryption, compression
  - Memory: Allocation patterns, access patterns, fragmentation
  - Storage: Read/write patterns, random/sequential access
  - Network: Data transfer, connection handling
  - I/O: Device operations, interrupt generation
- Calibrate stress intensity levels

**Key considerations:**

- Safe stress limits to prevent damage
- Progressive stress increase patterns
- System stability monitoring
- Emergency shutdown mechanisms

## 8. Sequential and concurrent stressing

**Conceptual Approach:**

- Implement a task scheduler to orchestrate test execution
- Use thread pools for concurrent operations
- Develop test recipes for common scenarios
- Support both time-based and event-based progression

**Implementation options:**

- Thread-per-component model
- Work queue with thread pool
- Event-driven architecture
- State machines for test progression

**Key considerations:**

- Thread synchronization
- Resource contention management
- Load balancing across components
- Deadlock prevention

## 9. Setting up data retrieval during stress

**Conceptual Approach:**

- Implement a separate monitoring thread/process
- Use timer-based sampling with configurable frequencies
- Create event triggers for threshold-based sampling
- Buffer measurements to minimize disruption

**Data collection strategies:**

- Fixed interval sampling
- Adaptive sampling (more frequent during rapid changes)
- Event-driven sampling (on threshold crossings)
- Batch collection for efficiency

**Key considerations:**

- Minimize observer effect (measurement affecting results)
- Synchronizing timestamps across components
- Handling collection failures during stress
- Prioritizing critical metrics during high stress

## 10. Functions for stress and data retrieval

**Conceptual Approach:**

- Create a uniform API across all component modules
- Define clear separation between stress generation and measurement
- Implement callbacks for event notification
- Use function pointers for pluggable stress generators

**Function categories:**

- Initialization/cleanup
- Stress control (start, stop, adjust)
- Measurement (synchronous and asynchronous)
- Result processing and analysis

**Key considerations:**

- Error handling and status reporting
- Graceful cancellation
- Resource cleanup
- Performance overhead

## 11. Modular framework for custom tests

**Conceptual Approach:**

- Implement a plugin architecture for custom stress modules
- Define clear interfaces for components
- Create a registry system for available modules
- Support runtime configuration and composition

**Design patterns:**

- Factory pattern for component creation
- Strategy pattern for test algorithms
- Observer pattern for monitoring
- Chain of responsibility for test sequencing

**Key considerations:**

- Version compatibility between modules
- Dynamic loading capabilities
- Configuration validation
- Documentation and discoverability

## Overall Architecture Recommendations

1. **Layered Design:**
   - Hardware abstraction layer
   - Core testing engine
   - Component-specific modules
   - User interface layer

2. **Communication Flow:**
   - Command-line → Configuration Manager → Test Coordinator → Component Modules → Hardware

3. **Data Flow:**
   - Hardware → Sensors → Measurement Collector → Data Validator → Storage/Logger → Reporter

4. **Control Flow:**
   - Test Coordinator → Scheduler → Test Executors → Stress Generators → Hardware

This modular approach will give you flexibility while maintaining clean separation of concerns. Each component can be developed and tested independently, and users can customize their testing scenarios by selecting and configuring the modules they need.
